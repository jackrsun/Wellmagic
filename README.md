# Wellmagic

IPython notebooks (and a python script) to do some magic things with well log data.

They can be opened and read in their raw format, or follow the links to display them in Notebook Viewer:

* [Synthetic data generation](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/aadm/Wellmagic/blob/master/Synthetic%20data%20generation.ipynb)
* [Synthetic data generation interactive](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/aadm/Wellmagic/blob/master/Synthetic%20data%20generation%20interactive.ipynb)


## Other stuff

1. qsiwell2.csv: log data from Well 2 of [Quantitative Seismic Interpretation](https://pangea.stanford.edu/researchgroups/srb/resources/books/quantitative-seismic-interpretation), 
2. qsiwell2_frm.csv: qsiwell2 + fluid replaced elastic logs
3. qsiwell2_augmented.csv: barebones well data, only Ip, Vp/Vs and LFC (litho-fluid class log)
4. qsiwell2_synthetic.csv: synthetic data generated through Monte Carlo simulation, same logs as in (3), i.e. Ip, Vp/Vs and LFC.
